    Continuous learning rate decay function. Adapted from JaxNeRF

    The returned rate is lr_init when step=0 and lr_final when step=max_steps, and
    is log-linearly interpolated elsewhere (equivalent to exponential decay).
    If lr_delay_steps>0 then the learning rate will be scaled by some smooth
    function of lr_delay_mult, such that the initial learning rate is
    lr_init*lr_delay_mult at the beginning of optimization but will be eased back
    to the normal learning rate when steps>lr_delay_steps.
